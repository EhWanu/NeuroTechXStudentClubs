					</h1>
					<p className="about-text">
						Neurotechnology has never been this
						accessible before. We want to catalyze the
						interest and involvement of skilled students
						by providing them with a precise goal to
						work towards and the resources to get there.
					</p>
					<p className="about-text">
						The NeuroTechX Student Club Competition
						promotes interdisciplinary collaboration,
						preparing the participants for careers and
						excellence in science, technology,
						engineering and mathematics (STEM) through
						self-learning, knowledge sharing, and
						practical experimentation.
					</p>
					<p className="about-text">
						We believe neurotechnology is key to better
						understanding and to improving who we are.
						We aim to inspire a whole new generation of
						neuroengineers, who will be equipped to
						drive the field forward.
