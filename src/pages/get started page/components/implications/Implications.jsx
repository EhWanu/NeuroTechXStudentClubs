						The student clubs are independant and have
						their own administrative structure,
						according to their university rules &
						standards. NeuroTechX does not have any
						governance nor authority over the club.
						<br />
						<br />
						NeuroTechX is an international entity
						putting a framework around neurotechnology
						student clubs. Most universities wonâ€™t
						finance a student club it they are the only
						one alike on the planet. We help student
						clubs point a finger at us showing that it
						exists and more and more universities have
						their neurotech student clubs and yours
						should too.
						<br />
						<br />
						NeuroTechX organizes one or more annual
						competition, either online or physical in a
						specific location and we strongly encourage
						all the student clubs part of the network to
						participate. You can find more information
						about the competition here.
						<br />
						<br />
						NeuroTechX acts as a partner/sponsor. And
						should be displayed as such on your student
						club marketing material (website, swag
						merchandise, banners, etc.) You can find
						NeuroTechX marketing assets here or in the
						shared G-Drive folder.
						<br />
						<br />
						NeuroTechX can help student clubs by
						donating devices (e.g. Neurosky, Muse
						Headband, OpenBCI Boards, etc.) this is at
						the discretion of NeuroTechX Student Club
						Committee.
						<br />
						<br />
						NeuroTechX will feature your student club on
						its website and give you as much visibility
						as possible. (e.g. share your events, your
						projects, etc.)
						<br />
						<br />
						The student clubs should buy their devices
						from NeuroTechX Store (work in progress).
						The devices are the same price or less and
						NeuroTechX gets money from it. 2 birds 1
						stone.
						<br />
						<br />
						We are working with our partners to get a
						discount code for NeuroTechX Student Clubs
						should be available soon.
